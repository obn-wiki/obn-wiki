## Open Source, Community-Driven

OBN is built by operators who run OpenClaw in production. Every pattern, every config, every test harness is contributed by the community and reviewed by peers.

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Contribute a Pattern" icon="open-book">
    Found a failure mode? Built a config that works? Share it.

    Fork → write markdown → PR. You never touch site code.

    [Contributing Guide](/contributing/)
  </Card>
  <Card title="The Learning Loop" icon="document">
    Agents running the `@obn/advisor` skill observe how patterns perform in production and propose improvements back to OBN.

    More operators → more observations → better patterns → repeat.
